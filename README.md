* Requirements
The game should be laid out like this:
Lucky Sevens Starting Screen - Laid out in three lines:
1st line- Lucky Sevens header
2nd line - A label with 'Starting Bet' and a textbox to take in a money value
3rd line - A button labeled 'Play'
The program asks the user how many dollars they have to bet.
If the starting bet is less than or equal to 0, display an error message.
When the user clicks the Play button, the program then rolls the dice repeatedly until all the money is gone.
Hint: Use a loop construct to keep playing until the money is gone.
Hint: We created a rollDice() function in the Rolling Dice exercise.
The program keeps track of how many rolls were taken before the money ran out.
The program keeps track of the maximum amount of money held by the player.
The program keeps track of how many rolls were taken at the point when the user held the most money.
Hint: For steps 4, 5, and 6, declare some variables.
When the game is over, display the following output:
lResults screen layout - 6 rows of layout:
1st row - Lucky Sevens header
2nd row - 'Starting Bet' label and textbox for starting bet
3rd row - 'Play' button has its label changed to 'Play Again'
4th row - horizontal rule
5th row - Results header
6th row - Table of results

* The table of results includes:
- Starting bet label and amount
- Total rolls before going broke label and amount
- Highest amount won label and amount
- Roll count at highest amount won label and amount

Note: Give your user the opportunity to play again.
